In this project-electronic voting machine using Atmega 16, we are going to display the vote count of each candidate in front of the name of candidate itself. We are going to develop the voting system for the size of two people. Because there are total 3 External Interrupts(actually 4-The Reset) therefore, we cannot make a voting system greater than 3 people implementing Interrupt Method using Atmega 16. For more than 3 people system, if we are choosing an Interrupt method, we have to choose any other microcontroller which has more external interrupts or we can choose Polling Method. By using PollingMethod, we can make this system for up to 32 members using Atmega16. But the thing is, polling method is less accurate than the Interrupt method
